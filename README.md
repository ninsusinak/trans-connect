# About This App 

the intention of this app is to create a hybrid of a blog publishing site and a social media site that takes insperation from early facebook where your social aspect was fully within your control with who you connect to, but also still be able to publish thoughts and ideas more widely, specificaly focused on the trans community as all other social medias do not provide a safe space for trans people, and hate is being proliferated under the false guise of a "free speech", my hope is the site will have general "free expression" not free speech as in people will be free to express ideas but not in ways that hurt, dehumanise and deligitimise others. 

but atm thats a pipe dream, i have a lot of code to write before i get there :)

## Usual React Run Scripts & Info

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
